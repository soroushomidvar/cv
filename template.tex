%\cvitem{Abstract}{Household energy consumption has a large share of global energy consumption. To have a better understanding of energy generation, management and surplus storage, we need to discover implicit patterns of consumers’ behavior and identify the factors affecting their performance. The main goal of this paper is to descriptively analyze the pattern of household energy consumption using RECS2015 dataset. To this end, we focus on selecting the most effective subset of features from high dimensional dataset that leads to a better understanding of data, reducing computation time and improving prediction performance. The result of this study can help decision-makers to investigate the living conditions of families in different levels of society to ensure that their lifestyle is well enough or should be improved. }

%\cvitem{Abstract}{Recognition of consumption patterns has an essential role in power management, and analysis of devices behavior is an integral part of that. Finding the usage patterns of household users, the main part of power usage, could significantly improve power prediction and power management. In this paper, the resemblance of devices consumption in a smart home is analyzed using time hierarchy. Finding relations between various devices and patterns of their usage is the aim of this analysis. This process led to the discovery of meaningful and precise patterns among the consumption of different devices.}

%\cvitem{Abstract}{In recent years, different malware has been developed and become more and more sophisticated. Botnets are among newly-emerged malware which is primarily used to perform malicious activities and are an important threat for nowadays Internet users. Malware can be remotely controlled after their installation on the host, as the victim system is unable to ignore received commands. One of the characteristics of botnets is their hidden activity, which makes it difficult to detect their presence on the victim’s device. Botnets are generally used to perform numerous attacks such as spamming, Distributed Denial of Service -DDoS-, identity theft, etc. In this article, we present our FUMBOT botnet which a centralized botnet, able to perform DDoS attack and utilize the bots for extracting cryptocurrency. FUMBOT was implemented in Java and can evade typical intrusion detection schemes.}

\cvitem{Description}{One aspect of using IoT in smart homes is measuring the power consumption of the devices (using smart meters) and recognizing their usage patterns. Smart meters data could help decision-makers for power consumption management, and due to the large volume of data, big data and data mining methods should be used for their analysis. Decision making and anomaly detection based on received data Increase the need for online processing. The purpose of this Thesis is implementing a system for the online processing of smart meters data and anomaly detection based on them. }
